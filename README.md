# Movie Recommendations Systems

## Type comparison for Movie Recommendations

* Content-Based: Use tags, director, actors, description, genre.
* Collaborative iltering: Use ratings from other users

## Collaborative filtering
* Approach 1: Find similar Users and recommend movies that they like (User to User CF)
* Approach 2: Find similar movies based on ratings given by other users (Item to Item CF) [as used by Amazon]

Approach 2 works better than approach 1.

## Quantifying Similarity

* Cosine Distance
